          <h3>ICT graduate | Web Developer</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a fresh graduate in Information Technology, specializing in Web
            and Mobile App Development. Throughout college, I worked as a
            freelance graphic designer and video editor, helping brands create
            visually compelling content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, I'm looking for opportunities to help businesses and
            organizations enhance their online presence through well-designed
            websites and web apps tailored to their needs. I have strong
            communication skills, collaborate well with clients, and am
            committed to delivering high-quality digital solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based in the Philippines, I work remotely and am ready to bring your
            ideas to life!
